# MachineLearning-HypothesisTesting
This project will help to implement the hypothesis testing on the Par Inc. data set

# Project Description
Par Inc., is a major manufacturer of golf equipment. Management believes that Parâ€™s market share could be increased with the introduction of a cut-resistant, longer-lasting golf ball. 

- Formulate and present the rationale for a hypothesis test that par could use to compare the driving distances of the current and new golf balls. 

- Analyse the data to provide the hypothesis testing conclusion. What is the p-value for your test? What is your recommendation for Par Inc.?

- Provide descriptive statistical summaries of the data for each model. 

# Questions to do
Check for the Descriptive Statistics.
Check if shapiro and levene tests work fine for the data.
Calculate Pooled Standard Deviation
Calculate Sample power
